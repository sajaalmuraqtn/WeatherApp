# 🌤 Weather App – Flutter

**WeatherApp** is a modern Flutter application that displays **real-time weather information** for any selected city.  
It integrates the **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch live temperature, humidity, wind speed, and hourly forecasts — all within a clean, modern Material Design interface.
